## Introduction 

One of my ambitions is to share content more often and a challenge I have in sharing is the belief that my content is not perfect enough to be shared with a wider audience. The two steps that take me the most time is in proof reading the content and in capturing my ideas. Usually when I do have an idea to share as a blog, I am in the middle of another activity which prevents me from recording the idea. Even when I do have access, the initial effort to capture and then structure the blog to a level I see fit to share is a high bar that I find difficult to scale. One easy way of building a habit, another possible blog about building a learning culture and habit creation, is to make the difficult easy and fun.

The goal of this blog is to track my progress in addressing the two challenges I have. Recording Ideas and structuring the content. To achieve this, I plan to write a mobile application which will capture speech and tranlate that to text. This text is then displayed on the screen and can be sent to OpenAI to be proof read and reformated. Once done, the app can publish this to github.
