Hi there! I'm thrilled you're visiting my learning journal. I'm passionate about learning and am excited to share my knowledge and experiences with a wider audience.

Before joining Maersk, I spent over a decade at Schlumberger where I started as a software engineer and progressed to become an architect, leading teams and driving innovative projects. During my time at Schlumberger, I honed my technical skills and developed a strong foundation in software development and team leadership.

I'm currently employed at Maersk where I have the privilege of heading their Customer Identity Platform. My role has allowed me to acquire new technical skills in Forgerock, IBM Cloud, and running production workloads on Kubernetes. I have also gained valuable experience using Kafka for eventing and Cassandra for distributed storage.

Through my journey with Maersk, I've developed a deep appreciation for the challenges that come with building and maintaining a highly available platform. In my joureny with Maersk, I have ventured into the world of management, starting as an SRE Manager and am now serving as a full-time Engineering Manager, leading multiple teams distributed globally.

I'm always striving to expand my knowledge and skillset, and I'm eager to share my learnings with others. I believe that management is a critical component of successful engineering teams, and I'm dedicated to supporting my teams and fostering a positive and productive work environment.

I hope that you find my learning journal informative and inspiring, and I look forward to connecting with you!
